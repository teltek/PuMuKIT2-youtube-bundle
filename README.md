PuMuKIT Youtube Bundle
=======================

Bundle based on [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) to work with the [PuMuKIT Video Platform](https://github.com/pumukit/PuMuKIT/blob/2.1.x/README.md).

This bundle allows to upload and publish videos from PuMuKIT into a YouTube channel.

This synchronization can be done manually from the command line or configurating the Cron tool to do it automatically according to a timeschedule. You can find more information on this in the Configuration guide.
